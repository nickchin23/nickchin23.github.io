                <h2>Wellbeing</h2>
                <p>I started acupuncture like most people thinking how can this work, there are no pills, rubs, or medicine to take, how can this help? We have many questions, some we ask and some we just say in our heads. Like, am I going to become a human pincushion? When I drink water I am going to become a human sprinkler? Yes, these are funny silly questions and we know the answer, but there are serious questions, too. Is it going to hurt? When will I feel results? How does this work? Can you help me? We have all these questions and rightfully so, Doctor Wu takes the time to know her patients and she makes you fell at ease and worth listening to your complaint. You talk about where your pain is and even if you don't know where your pain is, she finds it. Amazing!</p>
               <p>So you start your session with a _______, and an open mind still not sure what to expect. Secretly hoping that this _____ to help. You lay on the table and she says relax, before you know it your session has ended. Okay, you now have had your first session and think, "that wasn't so bad". When you take a drink of water, you don't spurt out water. LOL. The next day or so you realize you are feeling different, not sure how to put your finger on it, then it hits you, "acupuncture" could it be? Could this ancient Chinese medicine really be working? And the anser is <b>yes</b> it does.</p>
               <p>It is easier to explain if you are having pain in your neck and the acupuncture helps the pain go away. But, the wellness within is a little harder to explain; it is a feeling from within side of you, a lightness, and brightness, a peaceful feeling. You realize you feel GOOD, maybe for the first time in a very long time. You look forward to your next session.</p>
               <p>It's a feeling of balance, a natural high with out pharmaceuticals', with jsut a few thin needles. I think of it as an cherished silver vase that has tarnished over the years, still very beautiful but needs a little shine. This is what "wellness" from acupuncture does for you... You fell happy, bright, light, you feel positive, the tarnish is gone and you now SHINE.</p>
               <p>Wellness and balance you feel it... but everybody see's it, in your eyes, on your face, in your walk, in YOU.</p>
               <p>Thank you Dr. Wu.</p>

                <p>Dear Dr. Wu,</p>
                <p>Thank you for helping me get better. My head and stomach were hurting a lot. Then I went to see you and you did acupuncture on me. After a couple of times I felt better!!! Now it doesn't hurt.</p>

                <p>Dr. Wu,</p>
                <p>Thank you so much for helping me. I've been trying for so long, with Dr's to help my pain in my feet. I thought I'd never get relief, that pain was going to be a part of my life.</p>
                <p>My aunt and uncle, introduced me to you, to see if acupunture can help after a couple of months. I was finally free of pain. My feet are wonderful. I can dance the night away.</p>
                <p>You, also helped my stomach problems and my husband's knee from arthritis pain.</p>
                <p>Thank you again</p>
                <p>Richard and Angela Beeh</p>
                <p>P.S. "THE BEST STUFF EVER."</p>

                <h2>Pelvic Pain</h2>
                <p>I had chronic pelvic pain caused by benign cysts. My acupuncture treatments by Dr. Wu relieved my discomfort, and helped me to function normally and comfortably again. In addition, I was treated for menopausal symptoms and allergies, as well as aches and pains, with quick and excellent success. I am very greatful to Dr. Wu and her wonderful staff for improving my quality of life. I highly recommend her for whatever ails you!</p>

                <p>I don't know how to write this or what to say but here it goes...When I started to go to Dr. Wu I was weighing 197 lbs. I had struggled with my weight for the past 4 yrs due to my Thyroidism. Started gaining weight 4 yrs prior and was not able to lose any weight. I tried diet after diet, joined gyms with personal trainers... EVERYTHING. After only about 2 months with Dr. Wu I noticed a change. Today I weigh in at 166lbs and couldn't feel better. Dr. Wu has totally changed my life in more ways than she'll ever know. I'm happier and healthier. I'd recommend this treatment to anyone!!</p>
                <p>Thank you for changing my life,</p>

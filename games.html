	During my free time, I sometimes like to play video games. I played video games ever since I received my GameBoy Color when I was just seven years 
	old, I like to play video games. Previous consoles that I had in order were, Game Boy Color, Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast,
	Nintendo SP, Nintendo Gamecube, XBOX, PSP, XBOX 360, PS3, XBOX One, and my PC. Some of my favorite games growing up include, the 
	Pokemon Series (1st, 2nd, 3rd Generation), Mario Series, Halo Series, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Madden, FIFA, and MLB The Show. Today, I 
	still enjoy playing sport games. New games that I gotten into playing, is Battlefield 1, and Rainbow Six Seige on PC. I enjoy playing 
	these games with my friends. Below you can find my specifications for my PC.

	<p>I don't only play video games, but I also enjoy playing board games. Currently I enjoy playing
	Settlers of Catan, a game where one amasses resources to build their settlement, gaining a point for
	each settlement built, and whoever gets to 10 points first wins. I also enjoy playing, Munchkins, and Exploding
	Kittens. </p>

	<h2 class="center">Sports</h2>
	<p>Since I was young I enjoyed playing sports. I started playing baseball in my hometown and my interests of sports began to grown.
	Throughout the end of elementary school, I started getting a taste of basketball and football from an afterschool program that I would attend.
	middle school gave me a test of soccer. In high school I tried out for volleyball and made the team. Senior year, I won the Most Improved Player as
	I played libero for my team. Today, I still enjoying sports. </p>
